Networking:

Nodes = devices 
links = cable that is connected to those nodes/devices
ip address = internet protocol address/logical address of the device ip will change according to the location/device change
mac address = it will not change until the device is dead /physical address of the device 
routers hubs and switches these are the places where we use the network

ports are the location where we connect or where we communicate

full duplex communication - where both can communicate
half duplex communication - at a time only one person can speak and the other person can only listen

DNS -DOMAIN NAMING SYSTEM
DHCP - DYNAMIC HOST CONFIGURATION PROTOCOL
NIC - NETWORK INTERFACE CARD

NETWORK TOPOLOGY : Blueprint of the network or planning 

types 
- point to point 
- bus 
-ring 
-star 
-tree 
-mesh 
-hybrid

osi model(open system interconnect model)
tcp/ip -transmission control protocol - internet protocol

HUB- it is not an intelligent device ex: if main pc sends HUB some information to send it to the pc1 then it sends to all the pcs that 
	are connected to it because it doesn't know which one is pc1 
SWITCHES: it is an intelligent device ex: if pc1 sends some information to send it to pc2 it will send it to pc2 and it will not send to 
	 any other pc's or any other device.

OSI layers :

physical Layer- associated with data 0/1 binary data ex: pen drive 16gb ,WhatsApp.. we use HUB here.
data layer - media access control (MAC address)of the device, it will not change. we use SWITCHES of networking related.
network layer - prefers IP address that means when my location changes my ip address will also change it is also called as logical address of the 			device.ROUTERS.
transport layer-prefers TCP (transmission control protocol) reliable, delivers the order correctly ex: ssh,web browsing,emails,file transfer uses this.  and       	        UDP(user datagram protocol)fast but doesn't gurantee the delivery not reliable ex:online gaming,DNS, skype.. 
session layer - session ID'S it will be unique only for one group of session will be work others cant interrupt.
presentation layer- 
application layer -
